Buffalo MSEV - Explore Space In Style

The NASA Multimission Modular Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV) Is a radical new concept that uses common components for ground rovers and in-space exploration craft. This modularity opens up the possibility of a variety of different configurations. The Buffalo Modular Space Exploration Vehicle (MSEV) is the KSP equivalent from Wild Blue Industries. With the Buffalo, you can explore space in style!

Features
- Modular design lets you build rovers, aircraft, and spacecraft.
- Fits inside the standard 3.75m cargo bay.
- KIS/KAS friendly; you can assemble and disassemble the Buffalo out in the field.
- Crew spaces have IVAs with support for stock as well as ASET Props/ASET Avionics.
- Designs inspired by real-world NASA MMSEV with family resemblance to ground vehicles around KSC.
